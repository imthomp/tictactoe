'''
Okay, so I'm going to try to make a tic tac toe game in python. I think I will use a 2d array  to represent the board.
'''

array = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

'''
I'm gonna have a function that prints the board, a function that checks if someone has won, and a function that checks if there is a tie. Also, I might as well make a function that plays the game.
'''

def printBoard():
    print(array[0])
    print(array[1])
    print(array[2])

'''
Simple enough. I might come back and fix up the formatting later, but for now, this is fine.
